> One Variable Equation Solver - Python
  Input:
  1. Enter the size of equation you are going to enter (i.g. 4 for 3x=2, 9 for 3-2x=x+11)
  2. Enter your equation without any whitespaces
  Output:
  1. invalid - if after simplification the coefficient of x be equal to zero.
  2. p q - on the other hand, the value of x which satisfies the equation is p devided by q, where q is a natrual number and p is an integer.
